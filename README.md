### Data Description
The dataset contains an observation of the traffic flow at a specific place and time. It contains current and past measurements from traffic cameras in the city of Heidelberg (measurement interval: 15 min).
In addition to general location information, each dataset contains, if available, information on the number of vehicles and vehicle types measured, the average distance between vehicles and their passing time.

### Research Questions and machine learning objective 
How does traffic intensity vary throughout the day?

We will analyze the intensity of traffic at different times of the day to identify peak traffic hours. This involves aggregating traffic data by hour and visualizing the average traffic intensity.

Does traffic intensity vary by vehicleType?
We aim to explore whether certain types of vehicles are more prevalent during specific times or in certain locations, contributing differently to overall traffic intensity.
